# falanti-smania-computer-graphics-2021

Implementation of Whack-a-mole game for Computer Graphics course exam.
The project is implemented with just openGL, since frameworks and graphic engines were not allowed.

The game is embedded in a very simple node.js server, since some assets must be served to the webpage running the openGL canvas.
To start the server simply run:
```
npm start
```
